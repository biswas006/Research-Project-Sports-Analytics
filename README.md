Replacement for Chris Gayle in IPL based on Machine Learning algorithms 

Cricket is a game of uncertainty, and it has the second-highest fan base in the world after Soccer. Many models have been constructed to predict the performance of players and a few about classification techniques as well. This project deals with a specific problem of exploring options for replacing CH Gayle, an explosive batsman cum all-rounder, at the Indian Premier League(IPL). A combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms have
been implemented to find relevant players who can replace Gayle in the tournament. Moreover, it has been attempted to rank the choice of players in the selection list based on performance and given conditions. Overall, this study tries to build, compare and shortlist a model with higher accuracy, which can group similar players based on past performance and predict their contribution to reason about order of selection.
